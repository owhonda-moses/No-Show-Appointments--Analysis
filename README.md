#ABOUT

This project is part of the requirements for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. The project analyzes data from over 100,000 medical appointment records in Brazil to detect the trends of patients who show up at the hospital for their scheduled medical appointments and those who don't show up, and how certain variables associate with the trends.

110,527 medical appointments with 14 associated variables (characteristics).
The dependent variable tells us if the patient showed up or did not show up to their appointment.
Variable names are self-explanatory.
